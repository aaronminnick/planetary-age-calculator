## Planetary Age Calculator
#### _by Aaron Minnick_
### Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS (including Bootstrap)
* Javascript (Including jQuery)
* npm, webpack, eslint, babel
* Jest

This is the week 5 independent project at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com). The application will accept an age and life expectancy and convert the number of years into the equivalent years on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.

Check out the application [HERE!](https://aaronminnick.github.io/planetary-age-calculator/)

### Attribution:
The planet orbit animation was adapted from [this codepen.io page.](https://codepen.io/rss/pen/EWobGz)

### Setup Instructions:
_(Please note, the below instructions are using gitbash on a Windows computer. Commands may vary if you are using a different OS or terminal program.)_
* You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

* Clone this repository to your local repository (the link may be easily got using the green "Code" button on the github page):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronminnick/planetary-age-calculator
```
**Or** you may use the same button to download the files to your computer.

* Install the necessary packages:
```
$ npm install
```

* Run the 'start' script to build and launch a live development server:
```
$ npm run start
```

* **Or** run the 'build' script, then open index.html from the dist folder with your default browser:
```
$ npm run build
$ start dist/index.html
```
### TDD
To run tests using Jest, you can use the npm script 'test':
```
$ npm run test
```

### Known Bugs/Issues:
* None

### TODO / wishlist:
* Add bargraph animation for age output.
* Add sliders to manipulate age, life expectancy after initial submission and re-calculate.
* Modify planet animation to "spin up" and complete the actual number of circuits based on input age, then stop.
